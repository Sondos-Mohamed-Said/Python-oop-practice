##  OOP Practice in Python

This project is a practice on **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts in Python.
It contains several classes that simulate real-life entities like:

* **Person**
* **Employee**
* **Office**
* **Car**

Each class includes appropriate attributes and methods, and demonstrates concepts like:

* Inheritance
* Encapsulation
* Class vs Instance attributes
* Clean code practices
* Method overriding
* Using `raise` for validation

## 🚀 Project Structure

```bash
.
├── person.py       # Person and Employee classes
├── office.py       # Office class and employee hiring logic
├── car.py          # Car class with methods like run, stop, etc.
├── main.py         # Script to test and demonstrate the classes
└── README.md       # Project documentation
```

## 💡 Example Snippets

```python
def sleep(self, hours):
    """Return mood based on sleeping hours."""
    if hours < 7:
        return "Tired"
    elif hours == 7:
        return "Happy"
    return "Lazy"
```
