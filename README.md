# Python OOP Practice 🐍

This repository contains my practice files for learning **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** in Python.

### 🧠 Topics Covered:
- Classes and Objects
- Constructors (`__init__`)
- Attributes and Methods
- Class vs Instance Variables
- Inheritance and `super()`
- Encapsulation and Access Modifiers
- Method Overriding
- `@classmethod` and `@staticmethod`
- Error Handling with `raise`

### 📂 Structure:
Each file or folder inside represents a different concept or example I worked on while learning.

### 🚀 Notes:
- This is a personal practice repo.
- Some files may contain experimental or incomplete code.
- I might update or modify files as I continue learning and testing things.

### 💡 Why this repo?
As part of my programming journey, I believe in learning by doing. This repo is a reflection of hands-on practice with one of Python's most powerful paradigms — OOP.
