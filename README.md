# Python Practice 🐍

This repository includes various Python practice projects, modules, and exercises that I created to improve and showcase my programming skills using Python.

## 📁 Folder Structure

- `Employee-Tracker-OOP/` – A small OOP project that simulates an employee tracking system using classes, inheritance, and class methods.
- `Python-modules/` – Custom Python modules for functions like email validation, string utilities, and more.

## 🎯 Purpose

The goal is to maintain a growing collection of Python mini-projects and reusable code that reflect learning progress and practical understanding of Python fundamentals.

## 🚀 Coming Soon

- More OOP-based applications.
- Data analysis projects using `pandas` and `matplotlib`.
- File handling tools.
- Mini games and utilities using `tkinter` or `pygame`.

💡 **Note:** This repository will continue to grow as I practice and explore new concepts in Python.

Feel free to check out the folders and stay tuned for more updates!
