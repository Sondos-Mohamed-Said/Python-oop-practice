## my-python-modules

This repository includes several Python modules for practice and modular code organization.
Each module focuses on a different set of tasks or concepts like:

* **Authorization logic**
* **String-based tasks**
* **Pattern generation**
* **Task listing**
* A **main.py** file to run or test these modules

The goal is to separate concerns and make each module handle a specific area of functionality, allowing for easier testing and maintenance.

> This is part of a personal Python learning journey.
